LifeBox is an interactive simulation of class4 complex computation
and is based of the work of Rudy Rucker, Author of: "Mind Tools", "The Lifebox, The Seashell, and the Soul", "The Ware Tetrology", and many more books



LifeBox can be used to:

*Model Physics
*Model Molecules
*Model Chemical Reactions
*Model Cellular Organisms
*Model Multicelled Organisms
*Model Systems as complex as Humans and Societies

Much of Rudy's work in my oppinion has been spent trying to show that complex class 4 computations are Unpredicable, that is that they can not be simulated on any computational device faster than they are already being computed in the actual system being studied. Be mindful that when I use the world model, I mean that you could probably learn alot more by just studying the actual organism you want to study instead of studying the models.

The life box creates not a copy of the original organism but rather a tribute. 

I
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.
This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World.
